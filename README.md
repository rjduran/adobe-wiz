## Adobe Illustrator

### Working with Variable Data

There are two ways to do this:

1. Use the native Variable Data importer Panel located under _Window > Variables_

* [Data merge using the Variables panel](https://helpx.adobe.com/illustrator/using/data-driven-graphics-templates-variables.html#bind-object-to-variable)

2. Use the 3rd party script VariableImporter.jsx.
